Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize a small boy in your enclosure
In one moment
Would you capture him
Or just let him slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty, life's bleak, child is heavy
There's a sniper aimed at him already, mom's upsetti
Park service, they're nervous but look calm and ready
To embalm, but they keep on regretting'
What they shot down, the internet grows so loud
They open their mouth, but the memes
Wont stop Now
Provoking', how, everybody's revolting' now
Dicks are out, Harambe's down, over, blaow!
